Over the years, I've tried blogging in different places and methods.
Some I liked, and others.. well not so much.


I started off with
[nanoblogger](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nanoblogger), which I
liked - a lot. But it was a little clunky, and since it was
self-hosted, it was a bit of a pain. Especially since maintenance
always needs to be done just when I really don't have time for it
(Christmas eve, when work is stressing me out, etc). At some point, my
Gentoo setup exploded on me when running `emerge world` and
immediately afterwards, my raid array got somehow corrupted. I had
better things to do, so I just left it to rot...

Then, since I still wanted to publish my thoughts, I tried Facebook
pages (or whatever it was called) but when I decided to leave
Facebook, that option kind of dried up.

The platform I've used since is tumblr - and I've written a few posts
there at [blahonga.yanson.org](https://blahonga.yanson.org). The thing
is, I never got comfortable writing in a web form, despite me trying
to overcome my old habits. I prefer to write in my trusty editor on my
own machine - yeah I'm old-fashioned that way. So I noticed that just
avoided writing things there.


So now I'm giving github pages a try. I'm hoping that being able to
write in my editor of choice, having version control gratis and github
actions to update the site will make this work for me.

We'll see.
