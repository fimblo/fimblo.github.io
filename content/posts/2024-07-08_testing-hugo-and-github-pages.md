## A new site

Over the years, I've tried blogging in different places -


### Nanoblogger

I liked [nanoblogger](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nanoblogger),
but it was a little clunky, and self-hosting can be a bit of a pain,
especially since maintenance always needs to be done just when I
really don't have time for it (Christmas eve, when work is stressing
me out, etc). At some point, my Gentoo setup exploded on me when
running `emerge` just when life was hectic - and I just gave it up.

### tumblr

I have some posts over on tumblr
[blahonga.yanson.org](https://blahonga.yanson.org), but I never really
got comfortable writing in a web form, despite me trying. I prefer to
write in my trusty editor on my own machine - yeah I'm old-fashioned
that way. 

### facebook

I tried Facebook pages (or whatever it was called) but when I decided
to leave Facebook almost a decade ago that option kind of dried up.


So now I'm giving github pages a try. I'm hoping that being able to
write in my editor of choice, having version control gratis and github
actions to update the site will make this work for me.

We'll see.
